    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemistry is everywhere and companies transform raw materials into final products by understanding the chemistry and physical properties of those raw materials. Final products are sold at the stores and those contain chemistry that can work for us or against us. Thus, It is remarkable to understand about the ingredients and the chemistry that manufactured products contain to manage and consume them safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical compounds exist in different phases at specific temperatures and pressures in determined environments. Thus, people are more interested in learning about the right handling of a product that contain a chemical compound. For example: detergents contain a mixture of chemicals that could be transformed into other harmful chemicals when they are mixed or stored under stressful environments. As a housewife, it would a savvy decision to ask Mandy about some of the chemical compounds that are stored at home. Lotions, creams, make up and many other products that are bought daily also contain chemicals that you might be interested in knowing about before purchasing any of those.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application is divided into three different sections where you can integrate new programming code to make Mandy more powerful and useful for potential users. As you will notice, the application contains functions that contain code that directly related to each of these three section so that it will be easy for your to identify where you can insert new code or modify the existing one. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sections are mentioned in the order in which the application works after receiving a question from the user:\n",

    "### Wit.ai Technology Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Mandy – The Intelligent Companion is an AI tool that was programmed in python and that you can use to identify situations in which chemical compounds are involved. Wit.ai is the technology that makes you identify the intention of a user when receiving a question or comment at the start of the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can verify, Wit.ai technology identifies when users are interested in doing things that require them to know about the chemical compatibility, storage intention and information intention of a chemical compound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically the app identifies the following intents:\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Chemical compatibility search intention: The user wants to know about the chemical compatibility of a specific chemical compound. \n",
    "    • Storage intention: The user needs to store a chemical compound or product that contains a specific chemical compound. \n",
    "    • Information search intention: The user wants to know about the properties and characteristics of a chemical compound.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a Wit.ai Account\n",
    "\n",
    "First you need to create a wit.ai account so that you get an access token for your application. Type wit.ai in any browser with access to the internet and follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Click on sign up\n",
    "    • Submit an email, username and password\n",
    "    • Verify the email registered\n",
    "    • Click on the button create a New App\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable access_token_wit must contain the token that you generated from in you wit.ai account so that you can find this variable at the beginning of the programming code. You will find some code like this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "access_token_wit='XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chemical compound and Intention Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "Train your robot with data\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you obtained you wit access token, you can start training your robot to identify chemical compounds and intentions from the users’ message. You can train your robot on the wit.ai website or use the API that is provided so that you automate the training process. Here you can see how to implement the requests so that you submit utterances, intents, etc.\n",

    "    • Wit: this library identifies the user intention as something is mentioned on the input box of the application\n",
    "    • json: this library is used to handle data receive from the response of the different APIs integrated in the application\n",
    "\n",
    "This section contains a main function called wit_request that receives the question from the user and the token that was generated at wit.ai.

    "PubChem is a public library that contains around 13 million chemical compounds registered and that can be consulting by using different API endpoints. Mandy uses the chemicals’ names and identified intention to search about useful information that helps users to know what to do with the chemical compounds or products that contain them.\n",

    "#### Chemical Compatibility Intention\n",
    "\n",
    "Products sometimes are mixed, added, stirred, combined or put into contact so that the interaction of two or the same chemical may result into a third chemical, byproduct, product or waste that is harmful or undesired. It is then that users should know in advance whether the chemical is more likely to produce another chemical, waste or undesired product. For example, you may have baking soda at home and detergents that when they are mixed or are exposed to different environments could cause a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once wit.ai identified that the user is looking for information that states the chemical compatibility of a chemical compound, Mandy uses an API endpoint from PubChem to search the chemical compound and the most relevant information that is related with its chemical compatibility. The API endpoint response renders the data in a json format so that not only you are able to request data related to the chemical compatibility of a chemical compound, but also your will receive data that is related to structure, chemical and physical properties, safety procedures, chemical compound classification and much more. There are more than twenty different categories for you to identify and know more of a specific chemical compound.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API endpoint that mandy searches from is this:\n",

    "API_ENDPOINT='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug_view/data/compound/'+str(cid)+'/JSON'   \n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you use an online json viewer so that you are well acquainted with the structure and sections that you can extract and use in your own application. We suggest you to use this json online viewer XXX or any other more sophisticated.\n",

    "An example of the json structure that you will be working with is presented below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that you will be able to extract the data from the different level and depth with the json_extract function and extract subfunction. These functions parses the data and extract only the requested value or key of the API endpoint response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling_store Function\n",
    "\n",
    "handling store is the function that extracts from PubChem the data related to the handling procedures and handling guidelines that are suggested to implement when manipulating chemicals. It requires two parameters, chemical_compound which is the chemical’s name and cid which is the id with which Pubchem identifies a specific chemical compound. For example the benzene is registered with the id = 254 so that your API endpoint should be structured in this way:\n",

    "\n",
    "The Youtube Audio Transcribing Implementation consist of two sections full audio transcribing and text summary. First, it is meaningful to understand that using chemicals at home or at any other place should be taken seriously so that it is suggested to rely on trustful and reliable information from the internet. PubChem provides reliable information that you can trust, however everyone knows that theory sometimes does not happen as expected. This application looks forward to reaching out knowledge that have been applied and that can be obtained from experienced people that recorded and audio or video for training purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this section is that practical information is obtained from a youtube video so that you get the full text and a small summary. You may not have enough time to see all the video so that you just need the small summary and check the full content whether it interested you. Ultimately,  you could end up watching the video for further information and more accurate understanding of what you need to know about a specific chemical compound.\n",
